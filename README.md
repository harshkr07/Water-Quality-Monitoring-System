# 💧 Smart Water Quality Monitoring System

This project is an **IoT-based system** designed to monitor essential water quality parameters in real time.  
It uses an **ESP32 microcontroller** along with multiple sensors to measure:

- 🌡️ **Temperature** (DS18B20)
- 🧪 **pH level**
- 💧 **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)**
- 🌫️ **Turbidity**

### ✨ Features
- Real-time monitoring of water quality.
- 20x4 I2C LCD display for clear visualization.
- Push-button interface to switch between different sensor readings.
- Water safety status indication based on sensor values.
- Optional cloud integration (Blynk, ThingSpeak, Firebase) for remote monitoring.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: ESP32, DS18B20, TDS sensor, pH sensor, Turbidity sensor, 20x4 I2C LCD, Push button
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, C/C++
- **Cloud (optional)**: Blynk, ThingSpeak, or Firebase

### 📌 Applications
- Household and institutional water tank monitoring
- Industrial water quality assessment
- Environmental monitoring and research
- Portable and low-cost IoT-based water testing
