This system can be used in multiple scenarios:
Household & Institutional Water Tanks: Monitor drinking water quality in real time.
Industrial Water Systems: Track water quality in manufacturing or treatment plants.
Environmental Monitoring: Measure water quality in rivers, lakes, and ponds
Portable Water Testing: Low-cost IoT solution for field testing in rural or remote areas.
Research & Educational Projects: Learn IoT, sensor interfacing, and water quality analysis.



Future Improvements
Cloud & Mobile Integration: Real-time alerts via Blynk, ThingSpeak, or Firebase mobile app.
Data Logging: Store historical sensor data on SD card or cloud for trend analysis.
Automatic Filtration Control: Link the system to a pump or filter for automatic water purification based on safety status.
Improved Sensor Calibration: Use advanced calibration for higher accuracy.
Web Dashboard: Create a web interface to visualize readings with graphs and notifications.
Additional Sensors: Include ORP (Oxidation-Reduction Potential), conductivity, or chlorine sensors for more comprehensive water testing.
